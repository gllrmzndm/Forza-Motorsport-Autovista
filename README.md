# Guillermo's Forza Motorsport Autovista project



## Project story

**CHANGES**

All about cars, using:

- Vercel
- NextJS
- Tailwind
- Prettier
- React
- Prisma (ORM)
- SQLite as Database

**Notes**

- Backend needs to be fixed at vercel for the time being.
- DaisyUI Navbar needs to be added later on.
- Folder structure without the "app" folder.

---

In the first few tutorial articles we will define a simple browse-only library that library members can use to find out what books are available. This allows us to explore the operations that are common to almost every website: reading and displaying content from a database.

As we progress, the library example naturally extends to demonstrate more advanced features. For example we can extend the library to allow users to reserve books, and use this to demonstrate how to use forms, and support user authentication.
